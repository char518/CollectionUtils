# CollectionUtils
This utility has a collection of operations performed on Collections.

I intend to capture all the functionalities we would need with collections in our day to day programming
and get them to your finger tips. Some of the operations I intend to make available are
1) Union of two ArrayList
2) Intersection of two ArrayList
3) Difference of two ArrayList
4) Reversing an ArrayList
5) Sorting an ArrayList

and more...

I am regularly going through various interview questions related to Collections and I intend to implement
those ticky questions into API methods which can be called and executed in a single line of code.
